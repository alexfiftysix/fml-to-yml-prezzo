# Why?

---

## Change is hard
- Change without source control is harder
- Re-use between stages
- As much in source as we can
- YAML pipelines are a nice idea, but they're missing some things we like

<!-- In source (pipeline definitions, variables) -->

---

## Lovely old git

- Continuous integration
- Infrastructure
- *Continuous delivery*
- CI/CD variables (where safe to do so)
